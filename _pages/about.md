**I'm currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities that are aligned with my interests. Feel free to reach me!**

I am an undergraduate researcher majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, working on **efficient machine learning**.

I aim to build an intelligent system that delivers **strong problem-solving capabilities** at **low-cost**.
I believe efficiency is key to achieving the goal, and focus on two directions: **lowering the inference cost** of large models, and **improving training efficiency**. My current interests include:
- efficient long-context inference
- data- and compute-efficient training of large models
- system-level optimization of ML workloads



Aside from research, I enjoy algorithmic problem solving and have competed in competitive programming contests. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/diordhd) and [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/dhdroid).
