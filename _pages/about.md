I'm Donghyun Son, an undergraduate student studying computer science at **Seoul National University**. I am an aspiring machine learning researcher, and a competitive programmer. I'm currently interested in [modular deep learning](https://www.modulardeeplearning.com/) and in-context learning ability of LLMs. I'm also looking for a teammate for ICPC 2024 Korea Rounds. If you are interested in any of those, feel free to reach me via e-mail(happydh1@snu.ac.kr)!
