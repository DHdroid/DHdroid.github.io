**I'm currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities that are aligned with my interests. Feel free to reach me!**

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, currently studying abroad as an exchange student at UT Austin. 
Here, I am fortunate to work with [Saurabh Agarwal](https://saurabh.dev/) on building efficient agentic systems, advised by [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/).

I aim to build an intelligent system that delivers **strong problem-solving capabilities** at **low-cost**.
To pursue this goal, my research focuses on two directions: **lowering the inference cost** of large models, and **improving training efficiency**. My current intests include:
- efficient long-context inference
- data- and compute-efficient training of large models
- system-level optimization of ML workloads

Aside from research, I enjoy algorithmic problem solving and have competed in competitive programming contests. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/diordhd) and [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/dhdroid).
