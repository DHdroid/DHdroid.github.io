**I'm currently looking for Ph.D. opportunities that are aligned with my interests. Feel free to reach me!**

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, currently studying abroad as an exchange student at UT Austin. Here, I am fortunate to work with [Saurabh Agarwal](https://saurabh.dev/) on building efficient agentic systems, advised by [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/). At SNU, I conducted research on KV cache quantization algorithms under the supervision of [Sungjoo Yoo](http://cmalab.snu.ac.kr/member/yeonbin). Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/) (acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/)), where I developed ML-based content moderation systems for Match Group brands (Tinder, Hinge).

I aim to build an intelligent system that delivers **strong problem-solving capabilities** at **low-cost**.
To pursue this goal, my research interests focus on **efficient machine learning**: making **scaling more efficient** and **large-scale models more accessible**.
My current interests include:
- efficient long-context inference
- data- and compute-efficient training of large models
- system-level optimization of ML workloads

Aside from research, I enjoy algorithmic problem solving and have competed in competitive programming contests. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/diordhd) and [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/dhdroid).
