I'm an undergraduate student majoring Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, and currently an exchange student at UT Austin.
Here, I'm fortunate to work with [Saurabh Agarwal](https://saurabh.dev/) for an efficient agentic system, advised by [Aditya Akella](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~akella/).
In SNU, I worked on quantization algorithms for KV cache, supervised by [Sungjoo Yoo](http://cmalab.snu.ac.kr/member/yeonbin).
Prior to that, I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/) (acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/)), where I built an ML-based content moderation system for Match Group brands.

I'm broadly interested in efficient algorithms for model training and inference. My previous works focus on data efficient methods including multiple subtasks approach, domain generalization, and few-shot personalization.

Recently, I'm interested in building an efficient LLM inference system. Particularly, I'm interested in the following topics.
- KV cache compression: quantization, eviction
- agentic systems: optimizing multi-agent systems
- compressing the reasoning path

Aside from research, I enjoy algorithmic problem solving and have competed in competitive programming contests such as ICPC, Google Hashcode, and SCPC. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/diordhd) and [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/dhdroid).

I'm currently looking for job or Ph.D. opportunities that are aligned with my interests. Feel free to reach me!
