I'm an undergraduate student majoring Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University. I'm working on efficient LLM inference algorithms as an undergraduate researcher at CMA Lab, under the supervision of [Sungjoo Yoo](http://cmalab.snu.ac.kr/member/yeonbin). 
Previously, I worked as a machine learning engineer at [Hyperconnect](https://hyperconnect.com/) (acquired by [Match Group](https://mtch.com/)), where I built an ML-based content moderation system for Match Group brands.

I'm broadly interested in efficient algorithms for model training and inference. My previous works focus on data efficient methods including multiple subtasks approach, domain generalization, and few-shot personalization.

Recently, I'm interested in addressing memory bounds for LLM inference. Particularly, I'm interested in **post-training quantization** techniques, **efficient KV cache management**, and **sparse attention** for long context inference. 

Aside from research, I enjoy algorithmic problem solving and have competed in various competitive programming contests such as ICPC, Google Hashcode, and SCPC. You can find me on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/diordhd) and [BOJ](https://www.acmicpc.net/user/dhdroid).
